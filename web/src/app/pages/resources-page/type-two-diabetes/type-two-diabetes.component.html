    <h3 card-title>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
    <p>
      More than 37 million Americans have diabetes (about 1 in 10), and
      approximately 90-95% of them have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes most
      often develops in people over age 45, but more and more children, teens,
      and young adults are also developing it.

    <h4>What Causes Type 2 Diabetes?</h4>
    <p>
      Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas that acts like a key to let
      blood sugar into the cells in your body for use as energy. If you have
      type 2 diabetes, cells don’t respond normally to insulin; this is called
      insulin resistance. Your pancreas makes more insulin to try to get cells
      to respond. Eventually your pancreas can’t keep up, and your blood sugar
      rises, setting the stage for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. High blood
      sugar is damaging to the body and can cause other serious health problems,
      such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.

    <h4>Symptoms and Risk Factors</h4>
    <p>
      Type 2 diabetes symptoms often develop over several years and can go on
      for a long time without being noticed (sometimes there aren’t any
      noticeable symptoms at all). Because symptoms can be hard to spot, it’s
      important to know the risk factors and to see your doctor to get your
      blood sugar tested if you have any of them.

    <h4>Testing for Type 2 Diabetes</h4>
    <p>
      A simple blood test will let you know if you have diabetes. If you’ve
      gotten your blood sugar tested at a health fair or pharmacy, follow up at
      a clinic or doctor’s office to make sure the results are accurate.

    <h4>Managing Diabetes</h4>
    <p>
      Unlike many health conditions, diabetes is managed mostly by you, with
      support from your health care team (including your primary care doctor,
      foot doctor, dentist, eye doctor, registered dietitian nutritionist,
      diabetes educator, and pharmacist), family, and other important people in
      your life. Managing diabetes can be challenging, but everything you do to
      improve your health is worth it!
    </p>

    <p>
      You may be able to manage your diabetes with healthy eating and being
      active, or your doctor may prescribe insulin, other injectable
      medications, or oral diabetes medicines to help manage your blood sugar
      and avoid complications. You’ll still need to eat healthy and be active if
      you take insulin or other medicines. It’s also important to keep your
      blood pressure and cholesterol close to the targets your doctor sets for
      you and get necessary screening tests.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll need to check your blood sugar regularly. Ask your doctor how often
      you should check it and what your target blood sugar levels should be.
      Keeping your blood sugar levels as close to target as possible will help
      you prevent or delay diabetes-related complications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stress is a part of life, but it can make managing diabetes harder,
      including managing your blood sugar levels and dealing with daily diabetes
      care. Regular physical activity, getting enough sleep, and relaxation
      exercises can help. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about these
      and other ways you can manage stress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Make regular appointments with your health care team to be sure you’re on
      track with your treatment plan and to get help with new ideas and
      strategies if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you were just diagnosed with diabetes or have had it for some
      time, meeting with a diabetes educator is a great way to get support and
      guidance, including how to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Develop a healthy eating and activity plan</p></li>
      <li><p>Test your blood sugar and keep a record of the results</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Recognize the signs of high or low blood sugar and what to do about it
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>If needed, give yourself insulin by syringe, pen, or pump</p></li>
      <li><p>Monitor your feet, skin, and eyes to catch problems early</p></li>
      <li><p>Buy diabetes supplies and store them properly</p></li>
      <li><p>Manage stress and deal with daily diabetes care</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ask your doctor about diabetes self-management education and support
      services and to recommend a diabetes educator, or search the Association
      of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists’ (ADCES)

    <h4>Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Teens</h4>
    <p>
      Childhood obesity rates are rising, and so are the rates of type 2
      diabetes in youth. More than 75% of children with type 2 diabetes have a
      close relative who has it, too. But it’s not always because family members
      are related; it can also be because they share certain habits that can
      increase their risk. Parents can help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by
      developing a plan for the whole family:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Drinking more water and fewer sugary drinks</p></li>
      <li><p>Eating more fruits and vegetables</p></li>
      <li><p>Making favorite foods healthier</p></li>
      <li><p>Making physical activity more fun</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Healthy changes become habits more easily when everyone makes them
      together. Find out how to take charge family style with these healthy
      tips.
