    <h3 card-title>Testing for Diabetes</h3>
    <p>
      You’ll need to get your blood sugar tested to find out for sure if you
      have prediabetes or type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes. Testing is
      simple, and results are usually available quickly.

    <h4>Tests for Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, and Prediabetes</h4>
    <p>
      Your doctor will have you take one or more of the following blood tests to
      confirm the diagnosis:
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>A1C Test</h5>
    <p>
      The A1C test measures your average blood sugar level over the past 2 or 3
      months. An A1C below 5.7% is normal, between 5.7 and 6.4% indicates you
      have prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher indicates you have diabetes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Fasting Blood Sugar Test</h5>
    <p>
      This measures your blood sugar after an overnight fast (not eating). A
      fasting blood sugar level of 99 mg/dL or lower is normal, 100 to 125 mg/dL
      indicates you have prediabetes, and 126 mg/dL or higher indicates you have
      diabetes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Glucose Tolerance Test</h5>
    <p>
      This measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a liquid that
      contains glucose. You’ll fast (not eat) overnight before the test and have
      your blood drawn to determine your fasting blood sugar level. Then you’ll
      drink the liquid and have your blood sugar level checked 1 hour, 2 hours,
      and possibly 3 hours afterward. At 2 hours, a blood sugar level of 140
      mg/dL or lower is considered normal, 140 to 199 mg/dL indicates you have
      prediabetes, and 200 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Random Blood Sugar Test</h5>
    <p>
      This measures your blood sugar at the time you’re tested. You can take
      this test at any time and don’t need to fast (not eat) first. A blood
      sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.

    <p>
      If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, your blood may also tested
      for autoantibodies (substances that indicate your body is attacking
      itself) that are often present in type 1 diabetes but not in type 2
      diabetes. You may have your urine tested for ketones (produced when your
      body burns fat for energy), which also indicate type 1 diabetes instead of
      type 2 diabetes.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h4>Tests for Gestational Diabetes</h4>
    <p>
      Gestational diabetes is diagnosed using blood tests. You’ll probably be
      tested between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If your risk is higher for
      getting gestational diabetes (due to having more risk factors), your
      doctor may test you earlier. Blood sugar that’s higher than normal early
      in your pregnancy may indicate you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes rather
      than gestational diabetes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Glucose Screening Test</h5>
    <p>
      This measures your blood sugar at the time you’re tested. You’ll drink a
      liquid that contains glucose, and then 1 hour later your blood will be
      drawn to check your blood sugar level. A normal result is 140 mg/dL or
      lower. If your level is higher than 140 mg/dL, you’ll need to take a
      glucose tolerance test.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Glucose Tolerance Test</h5>
    <p>
      This measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a liquid that
      contains glucose. You’ll fast (not eat) overnight before the test and have
      your blood drawn to determine your fasting blood sugar level. Then you’ll
      drink the liquid and have your blood sugar level checked 1 hour, 2 hours,
      and possibly 3 hours afterward. Results can differ depending on the size
      of the glucose drink and how often your blood sugar is tested. Ask your
      doctor what your test results mean.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h4>Prevent Type 2 Diabetes</h4>
    <p>
      If your test results show you have prediabetes, ask your doctor or nurse
      if there is a lifestyle change program offered through the CDC-led
      National Diabetes Prevention Program in your community. You can also
      search for an online or in-person program. Having prediabetes puts you at
      greater risk for developing type 2 diabetes, but participating in the
      program can lower your risk by as much as 58% (71% if you’re over age 60).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Diabetes Treatment Plan</h4>
    <p>
      If your test results show you have type 1, type 2, or gestational
      diabetes, talk with your doctor or nurse about a detailed treatment
      plan—including diabetes self-management education and support services—and
      specific steps you can take to be your healthiest.
