    <h3 card-title>What is Diabetes?</h3>

    <p>
      Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how
      your body turns food into energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose)
      and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it
      signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let
      the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or
      can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn’t
      enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar
      stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health
      problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.
    </p>

    <p>
      There isn’t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy
      food, and being active can really help. Taking medicine as needed, getting
      diabetes self-management education and support, and keeping health care
      appointments can also reduce the impact of diabetes on your life.

    <h3 card-title>Types of Diabetes</h3>

    <p>
      There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational
      diabetes (diabetes while pregnant).
    </p>

    <h4>Type 1 Diabetes</h4>

    <p>
      Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the
      body attacks itself by mistake) that stops your body from making insulin.
      Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms
      of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in
      children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll
      need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to
      prevent type 1 diabetes.
    </p>

    <h4>Type 2 Diabetes</h4>

    <p>
      With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep
      blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have
      type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults
      (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may not
      notice any symptoms, so it’s important to get your blood sugar tested if
      you’re at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy
      lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being
      active.
    </p>

    <h4>Gestational Diabetes</h4>
    <p>
      Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had
      diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher
      risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after
      your baby is born but increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in
      life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child or teen, and
      more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life too.

    <h3 card-title>Prediabetes</h3>

    <p>
      In the United States, 96 million adults—more than 1 in 3—have prediabetes.
      What’s more, more than 8 in 10 of them don’t know they have it. With
      prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high
      enough yet to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes raises your
      risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. The good news is if
      you have prediabetes, a CDC-recognized lifestyle change program can help
      you take healthy steps to reverse it.
